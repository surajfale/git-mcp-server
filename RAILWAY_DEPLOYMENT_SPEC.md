# Railway Deployment Specification Update

## Summary

Updated the Git Commit MCP Server specification to include Railway deployment as the primary cloud hosting platform.

## Changes Made

### 1. Requirements Document (.kiro/specs/git-commit-mcp-server/requirements.md)

**Added Requirement 10: Railway Deployment**

New acceptance criteria:
- Dockerfile optimized for Railway deployment
- Support for Railway's volume mounting for persistent storage
- Automatic workspace directory creation on startup
- Repository reuse across restarts using persistent volumes
- railway.json configuration file for automated deployment
- Configuration via Railway environment variables
- Cleanup mechanisms to prevent disk space exhaustion

### 2. Design Document (.kiro/specs/git-commit-mcp-server/design.md)

**Added Railway Deployment Section**

Includes:
- **railway.json configuration** - Build and deploy settings
- **Dockerfile for Railway** - Optimized with Git, SSH, health checks
- **Environment Variables** - Required and optional configurations
- **Volume Configuration** - Persistent storage setup (2-5 GB)
- **Deployment Steps** - Complete walkthrough from GitHub to production
- **Railway-Specific Considerations** - PORT binding, health checks, logging, scaling

### 3. Tasks Document (.kiro/specs/git-commit-mcp-server/tasks.md)

**Updated Tasks 15-17 for Railway**

#### Task 15: Create Docker containerization for Railway
- 15.1: Write Railway-optimized Dockerfile
- 15.2: Update config for Railway's PORT environment variable
- 15.3: Create .env.example with Railway-specific documentation

#### Task 16: Create Railway deployment configuration
- 16.1: Create railway.json configuration file
- 16.2: Create detailed Railway deployment documentation
- 16.3: Add workspace cleanup mechanism

#### Task 17: Update documentation for Railway hosting
- 17.1: Update README.md with Railway deployment section
- 17.2: Create Railway troubleshooting guide
- 17.3: Add API documentation for remote clients (optional)

## Key Features of Railway Deployment

### Persistent Storage
- **Volume Mount**: `/data` directory persists across deployments
- **Workspace**: Cloned repos stored in `/data/git-workspaces`
- **Benefits**: No re-cloning, faster operations, reduced bandwidth

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: All config via Railway dashboard
- **Dynamic Port**: Supports Railway's `PORT` environment variable
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring

### Security
- **Authentication**: Bearer token via `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`
- **SSH/HTTPS**: Support for Git authentication
- **CORS**: Configurable origins for web clients

### Monitoring
- **Logs**: All output captured by Railway
- **Health Checks**: Automatic service monitoring
- **Metrics**: Optional metrics endpoint

## Next Steps

To implement Railway deployment:

1. **Execute Task 15**: Create Dockerfile and configuration
2. **Execute Task 16**: Set up Railway-specific files
3. **Execute Task 17**: Update documentation
4. **Test Deployment**: Deploy to Railway and verify functionality

## Railway Hobby Plan Benefits

- ✅ Persistent volumes included
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS
- ✅ GitHub integration
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Automatic deployments
- ✅ Built-in monitoring
- ✅ Custom domain support

## Files to Create

1. `Dockerfile` - Railway-optimized container
2. `railway.json` - Railway configuration
3. `.env.example` - Environment variable template
4. `docs/railway-deployment.md` - Detailed deployment guide
5. Updated `README.md` - Railway deployment section

## Estimated Implementation Time

- Task 15: 2-3 hours
- Task 16: 2-3 hours
- Task 17: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 5-8 hours
