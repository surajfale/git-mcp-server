# Product Overview

Git Commit MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that automates Git commit workflows. It provides AI assistants with the ability to:

- Automatically detect file changes in Git repositories
- Generate conventional commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification
- Intelligently determine commit types (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.) based on file changes
- Maintain an automated CHANGELOG.md file with commit history
- Handle Git push operations with explicit user confirmation

The server integrates seamlessly with AI assistants that support MCP, enabling natural language Git workflows while maintaining professional commit standards.
