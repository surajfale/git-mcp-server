# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that automates Git commit workflows. The server will track changes, generate conventional commit messages, handle commits, manage push operations with user confirmation, and maintain a changelog file.

## Glossary

- **MCP Server**: The Model Context Protocol server application that provides Git commit automation tools
- **Conventional Commit**: A commit message format following the Conventional Commits specification (type(scope): description)
- **Change Tracker**: The component that identifies modified, added, and deleted files since the last commit
- **Commit Message Generator**: The component that creates structured commit messages based on detected changes
- **Changelog Manager**: The component that maintains the CHANGELOG.md file with commit history
- **User Confirmation**: An interactive prompt requiring explicit user approval before executing push operations
- **Transport Protocol**: The communication mechanism used to connect clients to the MCP Server (stdio, HTTP/SSE, WebSocket)
- **Remote Hosting**: Deployment of the MCP Server on a remote server accessible over the network
- **Authentication Token**: A secure credential used to authenticate clients connecting to the remote MCP Server
- **Repository Access**: The mechanism by which the remote MCP Server accesses Git repositories (local clone, SSH, HTTPS)

2. WHEN generating the commit message, THE Commit Message Generator SHALL limit the summary to a maximum of 2 lines
3. WHEN generating the commit message, THE Commit Message Generator SHALL include a maximum of 5 bullet points describing the changes
4. WHEN generating the commit message, THE Commit Message Generator SHALL analyze file changes to determine the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, chore, docs, etc.)
5. WHEN multiple change types exist, THE Commit Message Generator SHALL select the most significant type as the primary commit type

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to commit all tracked changes automatically, so that I can streamline my commit workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commit message is generated, THE MCP Server SHALL stage all tracked changes using git add
2. WHEN changes are staged, THE MCP Server SHALL create a commit with the generated message
3. WHEN the commit operation fails, THE MCP Server SHALL return an error message with the failure reason
4. WHEN the commit succeeds, THE MCP Server SHALL return the commit hash and summary
5. WHEN untracked files exist, THE MCP Server SHALL exclude them from the commit operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to approve push operations before they execute, so that I maintain control over what gets pushed to the remote repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commit is created successfully, THE MCP Server SHALL prompt the user for push confirmation
2. WHEN the user approves the push, THE MCP Server SHALL execute git push to the current branch
3. WHEN the user declines the push, THE MCP Server SHALL skip the push operation and notify the user
4. WHEN the push operation fails, THE MCP Server SHALL return an error message with the failure reason
5. WHEN the push succeeds, THE MCP Server SHALL return a confirmation message with the branch name

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain a changelog file automatically, so that I have a readable history of all commits and pushes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a commit is created, THE Changelog Manager SHALL append an entry to the CHANGELOG.md file
2. WHEN creating a changelog entry, THE Changelog Manager SHALL include the commit date and time
3. WHEN creating a changelog entry, THE Changelog Manager SHALL include the commit hash
4. WHEN creating a changelog entry, THE Changelog Manager SHALL include the commit message
5. WHEN creating a changelog entry, THE Changelog Manager SHALL indicate whether the commit was pushed to remote
6. WHEN the CHANGELOG.md file does not exist, THE Changelog Manager SHALL create it with appropriate headers
7. WHEN appending to CHANGELOG.md, THE Changelog Manager SHALL maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to host the MCP server remotely, so that I can access Git automation from any client without local installation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is started in remote mode, THE MCP Server SHALL listen for HTTP connections on a configurable port
2. WHEN the server is started in remote mode, THE MCP Server SHALL support Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses
3. WHEN a client connects to the remote server, THE MCP Server SHALL validate the authentication token before processing requests
4. WHEN an invalid authentication token is provided, THE MCP Server SHALL reject the connection with an authentication error
5. WHEN the server is started in local mode, THE MCP Server SHALL use stdio transport for communication

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the server for different deployment environments, so that I can deploy to cloud platforms or traditional servers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts, THE MCP Server SHALL read configuration from environment variables or a configuration file
2. WHEN configured for remote hosting, THE MCP Server SHALL support HTTPS with TLS certificates for secure communication
3. WHEN configured for remote hosting, THE MCP Server SHALL allow configuration of CORS headers for web-based clients
4. WHEN configured for remote hosting, THE MCP Server SHALL support multiple concurrent client connections
5. WHEN the server encounters a configuration error, THE MCP Server SHALL log the error and fail to start with a clear error message

### Requirement 8
